# JenkinsAssignment
Objective: Automate the building of your application using Jenkins. 

Begin this assignment by installing Jenkins on your public Windows instance in you AWS account.

Part 1.
In your GitHub account, configure Integrations & Services to allow Jenkins access to the repository you created last week.

Part 2.
Connect to the Jenkins server and build a manual job. Your manual job must pull code from your GitHub repository and build using the supplied makefile.

Please name your Job SWDV 460 Manual - YOUR NAME. Then, when you configure the job, enter a description of the job and your name.

Part 3. 
Create a second Jenkins job that pulls source code from the same GitHub repository as Part 2 and build the code. I want you to configure GitHub to trigger the job on the Jenkins server.  

Please name your Job SWDV 460 Automated - YOUR NAME.  Then, when you configure the job, enter a description of the job and your name.

Assignment Submission Process
Submit the link to your GitHub repository. I will be able to see your jobs in Jenkins and will grade from there appropriately.
